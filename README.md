# PythonLibraryManagementCode
Hello and welcome to the readme file for my project.
Before going into the code I'll suggest to get a cup of coffee because it'll add to the user experience.
The code does what its supposed to do but with extra functionality.
In the checkout and return tab you'll see List of available books and books which are checked out.
You can initialize the DB as well.
You can search books using Title, Author or Genre
You can purchase new books on basis of popularity.
It's only based on popularity so that the Librarian cannot just buy books he likes.
You can see the time and the weather in the program too.
It works without internet but I'll suggest you to be connected to it before running the code.
Code Lacks OOP mainly because of my poor grip on OOP.
Code has reuses a lot of functions.
But at the same time there are some functions that had to be repeated. 
Code is well Labelled, has all the necessary docstrings and comments. 
Nothing is being destroyed but rather I used forget().
Search is not being done dynaically but rather I am using dynamic table for available and not available books.
At no point you'll need to initialize the DB or anything.
None of the files are talking to DB excpet databse.py
